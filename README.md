# NRogue

This is a pet project of mine, written in pygame via python3.

I was inspired by the ASCII-based game Brogue initially, but have developed my ideas to become my own.

The goal of the game is to survive past several levels of dungeons, pick up a special item, and make it all the way back up to the top without dying.
You get points for the time it takes to beat the game, and also for picking up money and killing enemies.

Currently, NRogue can be described as:
  topdown
  roguelike
  dungeon crawler
  shooter
